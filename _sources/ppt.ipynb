    "\n",
    "- Additionally, the book includes debugging, output, and coding questions tailored for different proficiency levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Debugging: Identify errors within a given code.\n",
    "    - Output: Determine the output produced by a given code.\n",
    "    - Coding: Write code for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "      \n",
    "- There is a separate section on how to use Google Colaboratory to write and execute Python code. However, the code in this book can be used in any major Python editor.\n",
