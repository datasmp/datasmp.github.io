    "One of the most common questions that I have been asked is how to learn Python. These questions come from people of different age groups, fields, and education levels. Most of these individuals do not have any coding experience at all. What they are usually looking for is a source that they can understand easily without tackling technical terminology. This is the purpose of preparing this online book. Through this book, the aim is to explain Python concepts using simple language, in a manner that individuals from any field and at any level of expertise can understand. After working on this book, readers will be able to grasp the ability to comprehend and write medium-sized Python code. The examples focus on solving real-life problems by constructing computational models and algorithms.\n",

    "There is a separate section on how to use Google Colaboratory to write and execute Python code. However, the code in this book can be used in any major Python editor. It is easy to use Google Colab because you do not need to install any program on your computer. It is also possible to write your code on a tablet and store it in your Google Drive. Also, Google Colab makes it possible to share your code and work on code as a group.\n",

    "Each chapter of this book covers a Python subject along with optional items. You can skip the parts that might be too detailed for you. However, it is essential to write and execute all codes in this book yourself. Whenever you see code in this book, try to write it in your code editor and execute it. If possible, make some small changes to check your understanding. You can copy/paste the code, but for beginners, it is better to write the code yourself.\n",

    "Additionally, the book includes debugging, output, and coding questions tailored for different proficiency levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Debugging: Identify errors within a given code.\n",
    "     - These questions help you understand the syntax better and have an idea about the most common mistakes.\n",
    "     - In these questions, first try to find mistakes, then think about how to solve them.\n",
    "     - It is strongly recommended to write the correct code and execute it just to be sure it works well.\n",
    "- Output: Determine the output produced by a given code.\n",
    "     - By solving these kinds of questions, you will be able to understand each small detail of a code.\n",
    "     - The best way to solve these questions is to work on paper and not look at the solution until being sure about your answer.\n",
    "     - Also, it is a great practice to try to change this code and write it in a different, and if possible, better or shorter way.\n",
    "- Coding: Write code for specific tasks.\n",
    "    - This is the most important part to practice your coding skills with various types of questions.\n",
    "    - The key point here is not looking at the solutions until having a solution, which might be even a partial one.\n",
    "    - Please try to solve the questions in these sections by using the information in the preceding chapters.\n",
    "    - Keep in mind that there might be more than one solution for such kind of questions. The solutions in this book might not be the best ones because simple solutions have been chosen for this textbook.\n",

    "This book will be updated very often, and a project chapter will be added soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is prepared by using Jupyter Book. Check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.\n",
